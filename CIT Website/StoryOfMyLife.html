<h1>The Story of My Life!!</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Andrew and I am a student here at BYU-I. I am a CIT major and I love working with computers. This webpage that I have created 
tells a short version of my life. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>I was born in American Fork, Utah! In the year 1990 on Thanksgiving day!! When I was a year old, I moved to Indio, California and lived there for a year before moving back to Utah,
specifically the Taylorsville area. I lived there for a few years until my family moved closer to the West Jordan/Kearns area when I was 4 or 5. I lived there until the
 start of 5th grade, when I moved back to the Taylorsville area. I lived there and went to school in Draper and swam for Kearns and later for Copper Hills while I was
 living there. Then, at the end of my freshman year of high school, I moved to Indiana where I lived until my mission, completing high school and a year of college before I left.</p> 
 <p>After my mission to Alabama, I flew out to Utah where my parent had moved to right before the start of my mission. I lived with them in Riverton/South Jordan area until I 
 came up to Idaho to go to school! This is the story of my life! Thanks for reading!!</p>
 <p>Cheers!! Andrew</p>
