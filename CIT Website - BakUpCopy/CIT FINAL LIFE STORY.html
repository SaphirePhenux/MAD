<h2>Welcome to the Story of My Life!</h2><br>
<span>Hello! My name is Andrew! I am a 22 year old college student at BYU-Idaho campus. I am a CIT major and I love doing all sorts of 
different kinds of code! I was born in the 1990 in American Fork, Utah, on Thanksgiving Day!! (which probably explains my constant 
hunger for both food and knowledge) Growing up, I learned a good deal about computers as my Dad was constantly writing technical manuals 
and teaching about computers. I used to live going to his office and pulling out the different books he had and reading through them and 
learning all about the different things that there were out there. </p>
<p><span>As I grew up, I moved several times and I met many new and wonderful people who taught me alot. I have lived in California, 
different parts of Utah, Indiana, and even Alabama! (Alabama has some really good food too! Just thought that I'd throw that out there.)
It's been a blast so far living in all the different areas that I have and I can't wait to see what the future holds! I hope I do well here 
at school! Wish me luck!!</p>
<p>Cheers!! <i>Andrew Bowles</i></p>
